# OldVersions

This folder contains archived or older versions of mouse-box parts and assemblies. These files are retained for reference and historical purposes.

**Note:**
- For current designs and parts, use the files in the main `mouse-box` subfolders.
- Only use files from this folder if you specifically need an older version for comparison or legacy purposes.
